Package: persistentBugger

Write a function, persistence, that takes in a positive parameter num and returns its multiplicative persistence, 
which is the number of times you must multiply the digits in num until you reach a single digit.

For example:

 persistence(39) == 3 // because 3*9 = 27, 2*7 = 14, 1*4=4
                      // and 4 has only one digit

 persistence(999) == 4 // because 9*9*9 = 729, 7*2*9 = 126,
                       // 1*2*6 = 12, and finally 1*2 = 2

 persistence(4) == 0 // because 4 is already a one-digit number

Package: findOdd
Given an array, find the integer that appears an odd number of times.
There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of times.

Package: digitalRoot
A digital root is the recursive sum of all the digits in a number. Given n, take the sum of the digits of n. If that value has more than one digit, continue reducing in this way until a single-digit number is produced. This is only applicable to the natural numbers.

Here's how it works:

digital_root(16)
=> 1 + 6
=> 7

digital_root(942)
=> 9 + 4 + 2
=> 15 ...
=> 1 + 5
=> 6

digital_root(132189)
=> 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 8 + 9
=> 24 ...
=> 2 + 4
=> 6

digital_root(493193)
=> 4 + 9 + 3 + 1 + 9 + 3
=> 29 ...
=> 2 + 9
=> 11 ...
=> 1 + 1
=> 2

Package: maximumSubarraySum

The maximum sum subarray problem consists in finding the maximum sum of a contiguous subsequence in an array or list of integers:

Max.sequence(new int[]{-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4});
// should be 6: {4, -1, 2, 1}
Easy case is when the list is made up of only positive numbers and the maximum sum is the sum of the whole array. If the list is made up of only negative numbers, return 0 instead.

Empty list is considered to have zero greatest sum. Note that the empty list or array is also a valid sublist/subarray.
